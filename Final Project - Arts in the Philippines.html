<p> The goal of this project is to impart knowledge to third grade students about the Arts in the Philippines. This topic is in line with the curriculum of the grade three students in their Arts subject. The information about the Philippine culture is introduced through Arts. In this way, they will be aware of how different forms of art are practiced in other cultures, in this case, the Philippines. It would be helpful as they will be learning through an in depth discussion with the help of a native of the said country. This topic is beneficial, not only to third graders but to other levels as well.
